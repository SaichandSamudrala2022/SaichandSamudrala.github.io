I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering at the SETH lab, Texas A&M University, College Station, USA. My research areas include Hardware security, Hardware accelerators and Computer architecture. I received an M.Tech. in Microelectronics and VLSI Design from the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, in 2021 and worked in Nvidia, Hyderabad, India, as an ASIC engineer from 2021-2022.
