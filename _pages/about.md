I am a Ph.D. student at the Indian Institute of Science, Banglore. My research areas include Low power techniques for IC Designs, Neuromorphic computing and Deep learning. I have submitted my Ph.D. thesis titled “Energy-efficient Hardware and Algorithmic Techniques for Design of Low-power Intelligent Systems”. 
I am an avid traveler, pursuing numismatics, philately, and historical and artifacts collections as a hobby.
