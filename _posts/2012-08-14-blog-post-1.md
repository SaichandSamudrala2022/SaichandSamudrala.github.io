Homo Universalis: Physician who invented probability. A civil engineer who invented the world's first programmable computer
======

"Gerolamo Cardano was a medical doctor and physician in Milan. He was a skilled gambler who invented probability and pioneered the first systematic approach to probability. The binomial coefficients and the binomial theorem were introduced in his book Opus novum de proportionibus. He introduced the use of negative numbers for the first time in Europe in his 1545 book Ars Magna. Cardano contributed to the development of the gimbal and the Cardan shaft. Pascal, Fermat, Newton, Leibniz, Lagrange, and Gauss were among those who were influenced by his work." --Wiki
Gustave Le Bon was a Doctor of Medicine. "The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind," his seminal work on crowd psychology, is well known. In the early 1890s, Le Bon built a home laboratory and reported observing "black light," a new type of radiation that he believed was distinct from, but possibly related to X-rays and cathode rays. He was even nominated for the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903. Le Bon predicted the mass-energy equivalence in L'Évolution de la Matière (1905) and lamented his lack of recognition in a 1922 letter to Albert Einstein. Einstein responded by admitting that a mass-energy equivalence had been proposed before him, but only the theory of relativity had proved it. ----Wiki
Konrad Zuse was a German civil engineer who invented the Z3 digital programmable computer. He is also regarded as the inventor of the modern computer.
